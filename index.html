We are new addtion to the area, but we hope to provide a comfortable spot for visitors or locals to enjoy a cup of coffee inside or on the go.  We welcome any curious coffee connoisseur regardless of your knowledge of coffee. Roasting our own coffee and growing in such a small town we are privilidegd to contribute to the beautiful community and provide a new experience. We are passionate combining the rich culture Bethlehem has to offer and constantly working to include it in our menu items. We are proud of our efforts in collaboration with local events. Most recently we had the opportunity to serve at steel stack's “cars and coffees,” Moravian University's “Coffee and connections,”  and this year's turkey trot 5k.

                    The owner, Julia Cortes, grew up in between Allentown and Bethlehem, and got the opportunity to create “Coffee House” after selling in local events with her coffee cart and traveling across the east cost for pop ups. Julia always had the intentions of COFFEE HOUSE being able to give back to the community in small ways as a small buisness. 
                    <br>  <br>
                    So far COFFEE HOUSE has hosted events for local public Schools and organizations to have the opportunity to visit the cafe and observe baristsas roasters and pastry chefs up close. As well as enjoy coffee, hot chocolate and have a sneak peak at new menu items. Julia plans to do more collaborations such as using local artists’ work for decoration, mugs and plates, and pottery for plants. She intends to continue to be more involved in events around the Lehigh Valley, and contribute through fundraising and donations.

Every cup is an experience shaped by intention, creativity, and connection. Our beans are thoughtfully sourced from small, fair-trade farms committed to sustainable practices, ensuring every roast honors both the growers and the land.<br><br>
Every hand-crafted brew and its expressive flavors, is designed to awaken the senses and help you tackle on the day whether its a boost for work or school or simply a “sweet treat,” . Roasting is an art where science meets creativity. Our roasters control temperature, airflow,  and timing to turn green beans into  aromatic coffee. Some of or flavors include chocolate, berry, citrus, or caramel!</p>
