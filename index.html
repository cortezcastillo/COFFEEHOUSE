We are new addtion to the area, but we hope to provide a comfortable spot for visitors or locals to enjoy a cup of coffee inside or on the go.  We welcome any curious coffee connoisseur regardless of your knowledge of coffee. Roasting our own coffee and growing in such a small town we are privilidegd to contribute to the beautiful community and provide a new experience. We are passionate combining the rich culture Bethlehem has to offer and constantly working to include it in our menu items. We are proud of our efforts in collaboration with local events. Most recently we had the opportunity to serve at steel stack's “cars and coffees,” Moravian University's “Coffee and connections,”  and this year's turkey trot 5k.
